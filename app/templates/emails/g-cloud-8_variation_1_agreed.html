    Dear supplier,
    <br /><br />
    Thanks for accepting the proposed ‘contract variation’ to the G-Cloud 8 (G8) framework agreement and call-off contract.
    <br /><br />
    The contract variation has not yet come into effect.
    When all suppliers have agreed, the Crown Commercial Service will countersign it.
    <br /><br />
    We’ll let G8 suppliers and buyers know as soon as the contract variation comes into effect.
    Until then, you must use the published framework agreement and call-off contract to sell your services:
